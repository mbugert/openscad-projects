# Bathroom Lamp Mount
If you need to mount a bathroom lamp, already have drilled holes in the tiles from the previous tenant, realize the holes don't line up, and have a landlord that doesn't fancy more holes being drilled, you need this contraption.

I guess woodworking would have been faster for this one, even without a workshop. Anyway...
