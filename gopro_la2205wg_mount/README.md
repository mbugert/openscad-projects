Adapter for mounting a GoPro on an external monitor. The monitor: HP LA2205WG [[1]](https://support.hp.com/de-de/product/hp-compaq-la2205wg-22-inch-widescreen-lcd-monitor/3955309)[[2]](https://www.prad.de/testberichte/test-monitor-hp-compaq-la2205wg/).

I don't expect anyone to own that particular monitor, but the design can be easily adjusted to monitors with similarly shaped bezels.

### Print Settings
* printer: Prusa Mini+
* filament: Prusament PLA Orange
* print settings: 0.2mm with supports
    * print orientation: ![](docs/adapter_printed03.webp)
      There will be supports between the adapter winglets which are annoying to remove. Printing it this way will make the visible areas of the part look great though.
